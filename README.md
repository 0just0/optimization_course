# Source code for labs for Optimization Methods course in HSE-2019

Most of the methods are implemented using IBM cplex and docplex. IBM cloud is being used to run the scripts. The estimated time for most of the problems will be around 0.00 due to the cloud parallelization and power. Execution on local machine should lead to the worse results.

Contains:

1. First lab(plane schedule)
2. BnB lab (BnB implementation is kinda rusty, the best I could imagine for now, though. meh)
